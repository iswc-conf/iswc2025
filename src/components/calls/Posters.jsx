                        The ISWC 2025 Posters and Demos Track offers an opportunity to showcase late-breaking research results, ongoing research or resource projects, speculative or innovative ideas, and interactive demonstrations. This track is designed to encourage dynamic discussions between presenters and participants, fostering feedback that can shape future research directions. These discussions will offer participants an effective way to broaden their knowledge of emerging research trends and to network with other researchers.
